# 📄 Bridge Service Overview

## 🔐 What is the Bridge?

The **Bridge** is a secure, smart middle-layer system that acts as a **trusted messenger** between Rapid installed in the bank's infrastructure and third-party services (like Tigg, Myra, etc). It ensures that the data we send and receive is both **private** and **authentic**.

---

## 💡 Why Do We Need the Bridge?

When communicating with sensitive systems (e.g., financial platforms), we must:

- Keep data **confidential** (no one else should read it)
- Prove the **authenticity** of the sender (ensure it really came from the trusted third-party services)
- **Verify** that received messages are **not tampered**

The Bridge handles all this automatically, so our internal teams don’t have to deal with complex security processes directly.

## 🔄 How Does the Bridge Work?

The bridge works in two main directions:

### 📨 When We Send a Request

1. **Plain Data Preparation**  
   The client (e.g., mobile app or internal service) sends plain data to the bridge.

2. **Signature Creation**  
   The bridge signs the request to **prove its authenticity**.

3. **Data Encryption**  
   The data is encrypted so **only the intended recipient** (e.g., Rapid) can read it.

4. **Secure Transmission**  
   The signed and encrypted data is sent to Rapid.

### 📬 When We Receive a Response

1. **Signature Verification**  
   The bridge first checks if the response really came from Rapid.

2. **Decryption**  
   If the signature is valid, the bridge decrypts the response to **get the original message**.

3. **Plaintext Delivery**  
   The final, human-readable response is passed back to the requesting client.

## 👥 Who Uses the Bridge?

- **Third Party Trusted Services or Apps** — they talk to the bridge using simple, plaintext data.

The bridge **simplifies communication** between both sides while handling all the security behind the scenes.
